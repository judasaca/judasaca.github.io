              development with Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, troubleshooting
              (algorithms) and SQL; I master frontend development technologies
              such as Html, CSS and JavaScript. I also use other technologies

              development team. I am motivated by challenges that allow me to
              develop and grow professionally, while allowing me to present
              robust and innovative solutions that contribute to business
              objectives.
